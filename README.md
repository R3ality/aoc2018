# Advent of Code 2018
Personal repository of solutions for [Advent of Code 2018](http://adventofcode.com/2018). Not yet decided on which language to use, but likely one of either PowerShell, Python or Node.js

Some are likely skipped or not started. A few are broken or unfinished. Most if not all are inefficient. Some comments or progress status may be kept in `notes.txt`
